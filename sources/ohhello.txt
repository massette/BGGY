But Death, she is cunning and clever as hell.
I took my chance and bit down deep.
The truth was a cave, on the moutain side.
Exeunt.
Reprise.
Bright as the morning sun.
Still the wild wind blows.
Mother Fortuna, O, she makes sisters of us all.
I can feel it on my tongue.
Constellations imploding in the night.
There's an eerie quiet on the southern levees.
Catalyzing with a breath of calefaction.
The river takes her shape from every tempest she abides.
